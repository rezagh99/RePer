    <p style="padding: 10px 10px">Relationship extraction is the task of extracting semantic relationships from a text. Extracted relationships usually occur between two or more entities of a certain type (e.g. Person, Organisation, Location) and fall into a number of semantic categories (e.g. married to, employed by, lives in).
    <br><br> Relation extraction for NLP is done to train the natural language processing based AI models to learn the relations with the different entities in a text to analyze the extracted data. There are various techniques to perform entity extraction, ranging from simple string matching to more sophisticated automated approaches. But the task is manually done by our experts meticulously can only give accurate results for AI or ML-based NLP.</p>

    <p style="padding: 10px 10px">Universal Dependencies (UD) is a framework for consistent annotation of grammar (parts of speech, morphological features, and syntactic dependencies) across different human languages. UD is an open community effort with over 300 contributors producing nearly 200 treebanks in over 100 languages. If youâ€™re new to UD, you should start by reading the first part of the Short Introduction and then browsing the annotation guidelines.
    <br><br> UD Persian contains data from multiple treebanks created by different teams at different times and with often different conversion tools. Currently there are two treebanks: Seraji and PerDT.</p>

    <h2 style="padding: 10px 10px; color: darkblue"><b>Seraji</b></h2>
    <p style="padding: 10px 10px">The Persian Universal Dependency Treebank (Persian UD) is based on Uppsala Persian Dependency Treebank (UPDT). The conversion of the UPDT to the Universal Dependencies was performed semi-automatically with extensive manual checks and corrections.
    <br><br> The Persian Universal Dependency Treebank (Persian UD) is the converted version of the Uppsala Persian Dependency Treebank (UPDT) (Seraji, 2015). The treebank has its original annotation scheme based on Stanford Typed Dependencies (de Marneffe et al., 2006; de Marneffe and Manning, 2008). The scheme was extended for Persian to include the language specific syntactic relations that could not be covered by the primary scheme developed for English. The treebank consists of 6000 sentence of written texts with large domain variations, in terms of different genres (containing newspaper articles, fictions, technical descriptions, and documents about culture and art) and tokenization. The variations in the tokenization are due to the orthographic variations of compound words and fixed expressions in the language. The original UPDT was developed by Mojgan Seraji, under the supervision of Joakim Nivre and Carina Jahani at Uppsala University. Apart from the universal annotation scheme and the general rules in the UD, the Persian UD and the UPDT differ further in tokenization. All words containing unsegmented clitics (pronominal and copula clitics) annotated with complex labels in the UPDT have been separated from the clitics and received distinct labels in the Persian UD. The conversion of the UPDT to the Universal Dependencies has been carried out semi-automatically. In this process, we used a conversion script for reversing the head and dependent relations in the prepositional modifier (prep) and object of a preposition (pobj). Furthermore, we have used other scripts tailored for Persian to separate different types of clitics from their host. Subsequently we added different rules for rewriting the coarse-grained part-of-speech tags and the dependency labels. In the current release, only a subset of the morphological features has been included. Adding the rest of the morphological features, as well as lemmas, remain as future work. We are extremely thankful to Filip Ginter for his help in developing the conversion scripts for Persian.</p>

    <p style="padding: 10px 10px">The Persian Universal Dependency Treebank (PerUDT) is the result of automatic coversion of Persian Dependency Treebank (PerDT) with extensive manual corrections. Please refer to the follwoing work, if you use this data: * Mohammad Sadegh Rasooli, Pegah Safari, Amirsaeid Moloodi, and Alireza Nourian. "The Persian Dependency Treebank Made Universal". 2020 (to appear).
    <br><br>  The Persian Universal Dependency Treebank (PerUDT) is based on Persian Dependency Treebank (PerDT) (Rasooli et al.,2013). The original Treebank consists of 29K sentences sampled from contemporary Persian text in different genres including: news, academic papers, magazine articles and fictions. This treebank was annotated based on a language-specific schema and its automatic conversion involved three main steps: revising tokenization, POS mapping and dependency mapping. In tokenization step, in order to separate multiword inflections of simple verbs grouped as one token in PerDT, we followed the guidelines in (Rasooli et al., 2013, Table 3) to automatically find the main verbs. Also we automatically separated pronominal clitics. In POS conversion step, we used the state of the art BERT-based Persian NER tagger (Taher et al.,2020) with manual corrections to extend recall. Through seven different entities detected by tagger, we used Person and Location to mark PROPN tags. PerDT contains 43 syntactic relations with no straightforward mapping for most of them, conjunctions arranged from the beginning of the sentence to the end and more importantly, prepositions regarded as the head of prepositional phrases and auxiliary verbs as the head of sentences. So we rearranged the order of conjunctions from end to the beginning through a script and tailored rules to convert each kind of relation to its UD version properly. Through the whole process and at the end of each step, we investigated the results and applied manual corrections if it was needed.</p>

    <p style="padding: 10px 10px">PredPatt is presented as a framework of extensible, interpretable, language-neutral predicate-argument extraction patterns. PredPatt bridges the deep syntax of the Universal Dependency project to an initial shallow semantic layer: this can form the basis for future layering of semantic annotations atop Universal Dependency treebanks, and separately can be considered a linguistically well-founded component of a "Universal IE" mechanism.
    <br><br>PredPatt is a pattern-based framework for predicate-argument extraction. While it works across
languages and provides a well-formed syntax-semantics interface for NLP tasks, a large-scale and
reproducible evaluation has been lacking, which prevents comparisons between PredPatt and other
related systems, and inhibits the updates of the patterns in PredPatt. In this work, Predpatt is improved and
evaluated by introducing a large set of high-quality annotations converted from PropBank,
which can also be used as a benchmark for other predicate-argument extraction systems. Predpatt is compared with other prominent systems and shows that PredPatt achieves the best precision and recall</p>
